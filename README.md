# Prework Study Guide

## Description

A demo web-based application which serves as a means for recording important fundamental aspects
of the various technologies learned as part of Code Boot Camp.
- This app and corresponding repository serves not only as a means for taking notes on technologies but
    also providing examples of their use.
- Why?
- This app and supporting code solve the problem of how to effectively record learned technologies as
    part of the Code Boot Camp in a way which best communicates how they can be used.
- Development of this app has required learning the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, GitHub/Git, and Visual
    Studio Code, and the Command Line Interface and this list will continue to expect as the application
    itself is expanded to encompass more technologies.
